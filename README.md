Welcome to our **Car Pooling website!** This platform offers a convenient solution for users to register, login, and engage in efficient carpooling services.

### Key Features and Functionalities -
**1. User Registration and Login:** Users can easily create an account by registering on the website. Once registered, they can securely log in to access the carpooling features.

**2. User Profiles and Profile Pictures:** Users can personalize their profiles by adding a profile picture. This allows for easy identification and adds a personal touch to the carpooling experience.

**3. Host a Ride or Book a Ride:** Users have the option to either host a ride or book an available one. Hosts provide details about the source and destination of their trip, while those looking to book a ride specify their desired source and destination.

**4. Nearest Car and Seat Availability:** The algorithm implemented on the website finds the nearest car with available seats for users with similar travel routes. It notifies the car driver and keeps track of the available seats in real-time.

**5. Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path:** The website employs Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path from the source to the destination. This ensures efficient and optimal route planning for carpooling journeys.

**6. Fee Calculation:** After the ride is completed, the website calculates the fee for the user who booked the car based on the number of passengers and the total distance traveled between each pair of locations. This provides transparency and fairness in the payment process.

**7. Real-time Journey Updates:** Users can view the remaining locations to be passed during their carpooling journey. The website displays estimated remaining time and distance, keeping users informed throughout the trip.

**8. Complaint Management:** If users encounter any issues during the ride, such as misconduct or discomfort, they can submit a complaint. This feature allows for resolution and ensures a safe and pleasant carpooling experience.

**9. Privacy and Security:** The website prioritizes user privacy by securely handling user information. Other travelers' personal information remains undisclosed, ensuring confidentiality. However, in cases of valid complaints, the admin can verify and provide relevant details as needed.

Our Car Pooling website, built using the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, offers a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for convenient carpooling. With its advanced algorithmic features and emphasis on privacy and security, users can enjoy a seamless and trustworthy carpooling experience. *Happy Riding!*
